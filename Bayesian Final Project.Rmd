Jeremy Lu: Report writing, presentation preparation, assist in summarizing key convergence diagnostics 


## 2.3 Raw Data Summary

### 2.3.1 Data Origin

Below is a link to a compressed CSV file containing US birth data for the year 2018. The data is provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and can be accessed from the National Bureau of Economic Research website. 

```{r loading, include=FALSE}
#url <- "https://data.nber.org/natality/2018/natl2018.csv.zip"
# get full 2018 birth dataset
#birth_full <- read.csv(url)
birth_full <- read.csv("~/Desktop/2123 Bayesian Inference/project/natl2018us.csv")
```

### 2.3.2 Data Clean (Include Variable Selection)

This 2018 birth data contains 3801534 obs. of 240 variables. We will pick 8 most interesting variables including: dbwt(infant's birthweight in grams), sex(sex of Infant), mager(mother's single years of age), mracehisp(Motherâ€™s Race/Hispanic Origin), meduc(mother's education), cig_rec(cigarette recode), bmi_r(body mass index recode), combgest(combined gestation - detail in weeks). Then we filter to exclude any unknown or not stated pieces.

```{r, include=FALSE}
set.seed(2123)

# Check all variables name
names(birth_full)
# Select 8 most interesting/key variables
birth_clean <- birth_full %>% 
  select(dbwt, sex, mager, mracehisp, 
         meduc, cig_rec, bmi_r, combgest)
# keep only complete cases
birth_clean <- birth_clean %>% 
  filter(dbwt != 9999, 
         mracehisp != 8,
         meduc != 9, 
         cig_rec != 'U', 
         bmi_r != 9, 
         combgest != 99
         )
```

### 2.3.3 Data Sampling

Since this birth data after filter contains 3643397 obs. which is still extremely large, we will get a random sample of births that includes only 0.1% of all obs.

```{r, include=FALSE}
set.seed(2123)
# Get a random sample includes 0.1% of all observations in the whole dataset
birth_sample <- birth_clean[sample(1:nrow(birth_clean), nrow(birth_clean)*0.001),]

# save it as a csv file
# write.csv(birth_sample, file = "~/Desktop/2123 Bayesian Inference/project/birth.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

### 2.3.4 Exploratory data analysis
```{r, include=FALSE}
#summary statistics for the numeric variables
```
**dbwt**
**sex**


### Explanatory data analysis (Some intersting features).
```{r}
birth <- birth_sample
```

```{r}
ggplot(birth, aes(x = combgest, y = dbwt)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
  labs(x = "combgest", y = "dbwt")
```
There is a positive linear relationship between mother's combined gestation time and infant's birthweight. 


```{r}
ggplot(birth, aes(x = combgest, y = dbwt, color = cig_rec)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```



## 2.4 Statistical Model

$Y_i$ is a continuous variable
